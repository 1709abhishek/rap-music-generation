"i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy

i wanted the fame, but not the cover of newsweek
oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
wanted to receive attention for my music
wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
been wanting my cake and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
when i blew, see, but it was confusing
'cause all i wanted to do is be the bruce lee of loose leaf

abused ink, used it as a tool when i blew steam
ooh, hit the lottery, ooh-wee
but with what i gave up to get was bittersweet
it was like winning a used mink
ironic 'cause i think i'm getting so huge i need a shrink
i'm beginning to lose sleep, one sheep, two sheep
going cuckoo and kooky as kool keith
but i'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause i'm

i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
well, that's nothing

...
yeah, it's been a ride...
i guess i had to go to that place to get to this one
now some of you might still be in that place
if you're trying to get out, just follow me
i'll get you there

you can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before i lay 'em
but you won't take this thing out these words before i say 'em
cause ain't no way i'm let you stop me from causing mayhem
when i say 'em or do something i do it, i don't give a damn
what you think, i'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
feed it beans, it's gassed up, if a thing's stopping me
i'mma be what i set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
and all those who look down on me i'm tearing down your balcony
no if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
from infinite down to the last relapse album he's still shit'n
whether he's on salary, paid hourly
until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him
whichever comes first, for better or worse
he's married to the game, like a fuck you for christmas
his gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge
to pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

i'm not afraid to take a stand
everybody come take my hand
we'll walk this road together, through the storm
whatever weather, cold or warm
just let you know that, you're not alone
holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

"feels like a close, it's coming to
fuck am i gonna do?
it's too late to start over
this is the only thing i, thing i know

sometimes i feel like all i ever do is
find different ways to word the same, old song
ever since i came along
from the day the song called ""hi! my name is"" dropped
started thinking my name was fault
'cause anytime things went wrong
i was the one who they would blame it on

the media made me the, uh, equivalent of a modern-day genghis khan
tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg
gangster? nah, courageous balls
had to change my style
they said i'm way too soft
and i sound like az and nas, out came the claws
and the fangs been out since then
but up until the instant that i've went against it

it was ingrained in me that i wouldn't amount to a shitstain i thought
no wonder i had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
do i really belong in this game? i pondered
i just wanna play my part, should i make waves or not?
so back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on

and i don't wanna seem ungrateful
or disrespect the artform i was raised upon
but sometimes you gotta take a loss
and have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
and keep pluggin', it's your only outlet
and your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah

feel like i've already said this a kabillion eighty times
how many times can i say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
what i really wanna say is
if there's anyone else that can relate to my story
bet you feel the same way i felt
when i was in the same place you are, when i was afraid to...

i was a...
afraid to make a single sound
...
yeah (illa)
yo, i'm just gonna write down my first thoughts
and see where this takes me
'cause i feel like i wanna punch the world
in the fuckin' face right now
yeah

let me explain just how to make greatness
straight out the gate, i'm 'bout to break it down
ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, i'm 'bout
to rape the alphabet, i may raise some brows
if i press the issue just to get the anger out (brrr!)
full magazine could take staples out
savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
but bitch, i'm off the chain like kala brown

motherfucker, shut the fuck up when i'm talkin', lil' bitch
i'm sorry, wait, what's your talent? oh, critiquin'
my talent? oh, bitch, i don't know who the fuck y'all are
to give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion or view
you mention me, millions of views, attention in news
i mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
billions of views, your ten cents are two

skim through the music to give shit reviews
to get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
don't get misconstrued, business as us'
shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
or get dissed 'cause i just don't get
what the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to

do you have any idea how much i hate this choppy flow
everyone copies though? prob'ly no
get this fuckin' audio out my audi, yo, adi√≥s
i can see why people like lil yachty, but not me though
not even dissin', it just ain't for me
all i am simply is just an emcee
maybe stan just isn't your cup of tea (get it?)
maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean

maybe i need to stir up shit, preferably
shake the world up if it were up to me
paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
i should eat a pill, probably i will
old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
i breathe on the mirror, i don't see my breath
possibly i'm dead, i must be possessed
like an evil spell, i'm e-v-i-l (evil, spelled)

jam a crest whitestrip in the tip of my dick
with an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
while i take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
like vice president mike pence
back up on my shit in a sidekick as i lay it on a spike strip
these are things that i'd rather do than hear you on a mic
since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
jesus christ, man, how many times is
someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (fuck my side chick!)

you won't ever see em icy

like you went to yale, but you probably went to howard
knowing you, weekend in miami trying to study by the pool
couple things due, but you always get it done
might've been a time when i loved her too
but you take that away and you've always been the one

one, i wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
maybe it's just right for the night
you said niggas coming on too strong, girl
they want you in their life as a wife
that's why you wanna have no sex, why you wanna protest
why you wanna fight for your right
'cause you don't love them boys
pussy run e'rything, fuck that noise

i know things get hard, but girl, you got it, girl, you got it, there you go
can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
when all these mo'fuckers wanna waste your time
...
with everything happening today
you dont know whether you're coming or going
but you think that you're on your way
life lined up on the mirror dont blow it
look at me when im talkin to you
you looking at me but i'm lookin through you
i see the blood in your eyes
i see the love in disguise
i see the pain hidden in your pride
i see you're not satisfied
and i dont see nobody else
i see myself i'm looking at the

mirror on the wall, here we are again
through my rise and fall
you've been my only friend
you told me that they can understand the man i am

so why are we here talkin' to each other again

i woke up around 10 o'clock in the mornin'
i gave myself a strech up, a mornin' yawn and
went to the bathroom to wash up
i threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
and said um ""mirror mirror, on, the wall""
""who is the top dogg of them all?""

there was a rubble dubble, five minutes it lasted
the mirror said, ""you are you conceited bastard""
well that's true, that's why we never have no beef
so i slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf
used oil of olay, 'cause my skin gets pale
and then i got the file, for my fingernails

i'm true to the style on my behalf

the highs, the lows

i'm an emotional rollercoaster (ah)
with highs so high, could put bol bol on a poster (mm)
but when the bread get low like four loaves in a toaster
or the shoulders can get cold as ten toes in nova scotia
some days i hold a grudge, some days i holy ghost her
some days i just ghost her, some days i'm supposed to
the crib feel like a gunfight, but them strollers, that's the holster (huh)
we can make amends over old memes and mimosas

my mama know i ain't make my bed, but i'ma lay in it
whether it's sandpaper, suede linen
whether i'm alone or creole lady marmalade-ing it
the same pajamas i was afraid in, i boogeyman slayed
my blankets concealed my blade in it, emotional seesaw
with two fat motherfuckers with strong knees in free fall (huh)
it's cloudy with a chance of meatballs, i checked the weather
i gave all my vices a call, let's get together

to talk about the highs and lows, the ups and downs
the friends that i had to hide to come around
they told me that i knew you'd always come around
come around, come around, come around, come around
to work out the highs and lows, the ups and downs
no need to hide disguises comin' down
go and get high, i promise you're comin' down
...
do you remember how when you were younger
the summers all lasted forever?
days disappeared into months, into years
hold that feeling forever

i remember the summer lil' chano got ahold of his household
the same summer that widowed gwyneth paltrow
back when i could trust in my dogs like balto
my family the sopranos these niggas is altos
first album, every track could be the outro
velcro to shelltoes, things that we will outgrow
used to rock south pole, summers taking the six bus to south shore
never sold out but now we out-sold

that was the summer i learned to love the great outdoors
learned you get the fans if you can't keep yo' mouth closed
that summer left a couple marcks like groucho
that halo can turn hollow, depending how low

comparing scars before dinner
jump off the roof into the mirror
felt like summer to my december
was it my august? shit, i don't remember
(two, three, go)

i know my temperature was set
you finally flew south
a bird gon' leave the nest, you're so chromatic
at least i had it (uh) instead of never
or maybe i'm too dramatic
(two, three, go)

whether it's rain or shine, i know i'm fine for now
my love's gone, my love's gone
my love's gone, oh, gone
(two, three, go)
or maybe it's just a dream that i can't seem to wake up from
my love's gone, my love's gone
my love's gone, gone
gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

i know love is all i got
i just hope to god she got the taste
could put you on some shit you never seen
could play a couple songs that you could dance to
i hope you know she can't compete with me

whether it's rain or shine, i know i'm fine for now
my love's gone, my love's gone

that's why i do it for me and the homies and nobody else
making beats in my room by myself
kinda funny how my last studio cost seven zeros
but i make the best shit when i'm all alone in my room
college park coming soon
in the dark going off to the tune of the 808 boom
...
you must remember me
you must remember me
let's go, ayy, now you know, now you know
yo, now you know, now you know

now you know, now you know

i just copped a mpc60 from japan
as i'm rappin' through this sm7 that's in my hand
got a quarter-pound of buddha, i'm smokin' it by the gram
if i don't know you, then you know i'm dappin' you up with the left hand
don't nothin' come close to samplin' ill shit
not even self-medication, no matter how good the sip
not the best weed or the things money can buy
when i fly your rapid programme, feel like i can fly

smokin' dope, listenin' to endless samples on vinyl
my flow primal, it ain't mixed, it ain't the final
but it's still ill and it still will destroy your decoys
we do this shit in real life, y'all a bunch of motherfuckin' e-boys
we do this shit for mc's, the dj's, the b-boys that destroy the track
spent most of my days just tryna avoid the wack
put it on wax, relax, count stacks, get racks, spit facts
pop the vhs in, we ain't restin', i'm a beast
the best in the east, capiche? food for thought, this is the feast

let it flow, let it go, you ain't know, now you know

my life was just fine way back before you
now when you reach out i just ignore you

'cause this ain't a love song (woah)
this is, ""so long""
you did me so wrong for so long
for so long, so long

no i never thought i could live my life without you
all you ever seem to do is scream and make it all about you

and so i doubt you
i doubt you even know what's on my mind
i said, i doubt you
i doubt you even know why i left you behind

i know that i've been living
i know that i've been living
i know that i've been living
i know that i've been living
in the city of stars, where there's flying cars
a brand new home for everyone and even life on mars

we're smart enough to know that no one gets out alive (never, ever)
hold on to someone close, friend
'cause you're never too young
you're never too young, never too young to die

remember the ghosts before you
and drink to their souls tonight
and don't forget what they told you
you're never too young
you're never too young, never too young to die

you're never too young
you're never too, never too
no, you're never too young
never, never

uh, tell me is it the day i made it?

don't know why i've been created
i've been under pressure but nevertheless
