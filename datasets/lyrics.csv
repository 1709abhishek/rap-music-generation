Title,Artist,Lyrics
Love The Way You Lie,Eminem feat. Rihanna,"Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off of love, drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint, and I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it

""Wait! Where you going?"" ""I'm leaving you""
""No, you ain't, come back""
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, ""Who's that dude?""
I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
..."
Godzilla (feat. Juice WRLD),Eminem feat. Juice WRLD,"(Ugh, you're a monster)

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walkin' around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby, ""The
Brain"" Heenan which is probably the same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia, ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisi' (hey, hey)

In AA, with an AK, melee, finna set it like a play date
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughin' all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the (ayy)

Monster
You get in my way? I'ma feed you to the monster (yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night turn to a monster (yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
(Godzilla, fire-spitter) monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
(Fire, Godzilla, fire) monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick, at Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled at so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper

My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with the missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
..."
The Monster,Eminem feat. Rihanna,"I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
Been wanting my cake and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf

Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Ooh, hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get was bittersweet
It was like winning a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep, one sheep, two sheep
Going cuckoo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothing

..."
Not Afraid,Eminem,"Yeah, It's been a ride...
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take this thing out these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say 'em or do something I do it, I don't give a damn
What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if a thing's stopping me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shit'n
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road
..."
Venom (Music From The Motion Picture),Eminem,"I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, ""Piss off! Screw you!""
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like-

Knock knock, let the devil in
Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
This medicine's screamin', ""L-L-L-Let us in!""
L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure, hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again

Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
Dr. Dre said, ""Hell yeah!""
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man

And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely can wait
To hit 'em with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my-

Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the-)

Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
..."
Rap God,Eminem,"Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance (six minutes-, six minutes-)
Something's wrong, I can feel it (six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

But for me to rap like a computer, it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (kill 'em all with)

This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half

Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce

'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""Bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students

Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame

Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
..."
Killshot,Eminem,"You sound like a bitch, bitch
Shut the fuck up!
When your fans become your haters
You done?
Fuckin' beard's weird
Alright
You yellin' at the mic, fuckin' weird beard
We doin' this once (you yellin' at the mic, your beard's weird)
Why you yell at the mic? (Illa)

Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter
I wrote it on a Starter cap

Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself
After a damn gun and have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, woo!
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines (""Slim, you're old""), ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you

By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!

Hoe, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (brrt)
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (hold up)
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?

What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material

Forever,"Drake feat. Kanye West, Lil Wayne & Eminem","It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mane, ever mane, ever mane

I shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mane, ever mane, ever mane

Last name ever, first name greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis

In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemo

Drop the mixtape, that shit sounded like a album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour would be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one

Yeah nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness
Bitches

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mane, ever mane, ever mane

I shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mane, ever mane, ever mane

Hey, ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em

I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring

Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
..."
Space Bound,Eminem,"We touch, I feel a rush, we clutch, it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible, gained my trust
Don't play games, it'd be dangerous if you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt befo' ya
And love is evol, spell it backwards, I'll show ya
Nobody knows me, I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever, so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these mo'fuckin' ho's
Blood suckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like tryin' to start over
I've got a hole in my heart for some kind of emotional roller coaster
Somethin' I won't go on, so you toy with my emotions, ho, it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, I wasn't jokin' when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova and I'm a

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin' right at you, right at you

250, 000 miles on a clear night in June

Love The Way You Lie (Part II) - Pt. 2,Rihanna feat. Eminem,"On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised

Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie

Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right

'Cause you feed me fables from your hand
With violent words and empty threats
..."
Lucky You (feat. Joyner Lucas),Eminem feat. Joyner Lucas,"Whoa, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it, then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food (yeah)
Pass the plate (yeah), where my drink (hol' up)?
This my day (yeah, yeah), lucky you, fuck you too, woo!

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room (woo!), give me some room (hey!), give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move (boom, bap), y'all gotta move (woo!), give me the juice

Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished (bap, bop, bop)
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin' (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin' (yuh)
You might'a went platinum, but that don't mean nothin'

I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys (woo!)
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time (yeah!)
I ain't no gangster, but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My Twelve Days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)

Run at you hard like a sumo (sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (chulo!)
I live on Mars, I'm not Bruno (woo!)
Bitch, I'm a dog, call me Cujo (rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw four like a Uno (bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón
Little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)

They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now (yeah, yeah)

Berzerk,Eminem,"Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the ra-aag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get impaled when I tell 'em ""stick it""
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shoutout to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of the MCin' mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch!
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch!

(Kick your shoes off)
(Let your hair down and)
(Go berzerk)
All night long

(Grow your beard out)
(Just weird out and)
(Go berzerk)
All night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'till the AM
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go
Let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (go berzerk), move your body

Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes, crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint

I Need a Doctor (feat. Eminem & Skylar Grey),Dr. Dre feat. Eminem & Skylar Grey,"I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day it's just so grey and black

Hope, I just need a ray of that
'Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for 'em
They just say it's wack, but they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin' you
It's dark, let me turn on the lights
And brighten me and enlighten you

I don't think you realise what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue, 'cause me and you were like a crew
I was like your sidekick, you gon' either wanna fight
When I get off this fuckin' mic, or you gon' hug me
But I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do 'cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time

Guts Over Fear,Eminem feat. Sia,"Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same, old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called ""Hi! My Name Is"" dropped
Started thinking my name was fault
'Cause anytime things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on

The media made me the, uh, equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg
Gangster? Nah, courageous balls
Had to change my style
They said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I've went against it

It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on

And I don't wanna seem ungrateful
Or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
And keep pluggin', it's your only outlet
And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah

Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is
If there's anyone else that can relate to my story
Bet you feel the same way I felt
When I was in the same place you are, when I was afraid to...

I was a...
Afraid to make a single sound

The Ringer,Eminem,"Yeah (Illa)
Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts
And see where this takes me
'Cause I feel like I wanna punch the world
In the fuckin' face right now
Yeah

Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm 'bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown

Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I'm talkin', lil' bitch
I'm sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y'all are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion or view
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two

Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to

Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adiós
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe Stan just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean

Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (Evil, spelled)

Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)

You won't ever see Em icy

Gnat,Eminem,"Yeah, yeah, sick
(d.a. got that dope)

Infected with SARS and Corona (infected with SARS and Corona)
Like you took a bite off of that (you took a bite off of that, damn)
And it goes from martian to human (from martian to human, yeah)
That's how the virus attacks (that's how the virus attacks)
They come at me with machine guns (at me with machine guns, brr)
Like trying to fight off a gnat

Still stackin' my chips, hoes
Higher than Shaq on his tiptoes
Atop the Empire State Buildin'
This shit is like child's play, childrеn
I will anni-nihilate, kill them
I'll fuck around and pile еight million
Dead little juveniles, wait, chill, then
I'll await my trial date 'til then (what?)

Ain't nothin' you say could ever trump (nah), mic, pencil get killed (yeah)
If you're hypersensitive, I wasn't referencin' the vice president, chill (chill)
I mean my penmanship at times tends to get ill, violence but with skill
That's why I hence when I write ends up
With the mic and pencil gettin' killed (haha, yeah, hold up)

And I'm still ride or die for the squad (yeah)
So you know which side that I'm on
If a battle line's ever drawn, but if I get involved
It'll be like K9's in a brawl
But not similar to Mike Vick at all
'Cause even if I don't have a dog in the fight
They ain't never gonna get rid of the fight in the dog (fight in the dog)

Got stripes like a tiger, so you might get mauled, a mic in the palms
Like claws, I can swing right for your jaw
And rip it off with one swipe of the paw
Bitch, you still on my dick or nah? (Nah)
If I suck, your wife is a straw (straw)
I'm sick and I'm not gonna cover my mouth next time that I cough 'cause

Beautiful Pain,Eminem feat. Sia,"I can feel the heat risin'
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder
Of why we can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin' out, 'cause

I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning
Today's like the morning after
Your world is torn in half
You wake in its wake to start the mourning process
And rebuilding, you're still a work in progress
Today's a whole new chapter
It's like an enormous asthma
Thunderstorm has passed ya
You weathered it and poked its eye out with the thornbush that ya
Used to smell the roses
Stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is
Stuffed, so focused on the bright side then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner faster, more assertive
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But every day is a new learning curve as you steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve but you have to
To avert a disaster, lucky no permanent damage
'Cause they hurt you so bad
It's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket

Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been

Yeah, I said it, has-been
Hang it up, flat screen
Plasma
Hey Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma

I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars, sentencin'
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that ho', punt

Forced trauma, blunt
You play the back bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with

You lil' brag-a-lot beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie, camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough

I ain't into S&M but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame

And I still wouldn't fuck you, slut, so wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God, I'll piss a Happy Meal off

Headlights,Eminem feat. Nate Ruess,"Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and I'm fucked up?
And, mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I went in headfirst, never thinkin' about who, what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far?
""Cleanin' Out My Closet"" and all them other songs
But regardless, I don't hate you 'cause, Ma
You're still beautiful to me, 'cause you're my Ma

Though far be it from you to be calm
Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm
And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we could drag this on and on

But agree to disagree, that gift for me
Up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kickin' me out? It's 15 degrees
And it's Christmas Eve, ""Little prick, just leave""
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat
Anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when Dad, he fucked us both

We're in the same fuckin' boat
You'd think that'd make us close (nope)
Further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine
And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go
Back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road

And I was the man of the house, the oldest
So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old

River (feat. Ed Sheeran),Eminem feat. Ed Sheeran,"I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""
After the first night, but tonight I am

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something

Now the diamonds in the Audemars bright
Jets overseas for a far flight (oh-oh-oh)
Young nigga on bullshit, and I ball on 'em, Bill Cartwright
Knew I could shine through the darkness
I guess I always been a star type

That lion in me made my heart fight
Could've been a victim of a opp pipe
Took a million risks just to get to this
'Cause we ain't the ones that the cops like
Been so many times God tested me
They only see the answers I got right
They commentin' all on the blogs
Tryna tell me how to live my life

And I waited so patiently
If you could take off, don't wait for me
No days off, grind faithfully
I keep thankin' God for savin' me
Front line, showcasin' our bravery
I know that top spot, it was made for me
It all paid off, so we felt the struggle so painfully

From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, fuckin' acronym
Cut the fucking act like you're happy, I'm fucking back again
With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves, when the thought
Of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff, came up rough
Came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough

Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt

'Cause this is survival of the fittest
This is do or die

This is the winner takes it all

But with what I gave up to get was bittersweet
It was like winning a used mink

Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day

Consider them my protégé, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still, I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day

It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away

Love The Way You Lie (Part II) - Pt. 2,Rihanna feat. Eminem,"On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised

Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie

Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right

With violent words and empty threats

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint, and I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She f- hates me, and I love it

""Wait! Where you going?"" ""I'm leaving you""
""No, you ain't, come back""
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, ""Who's that dude?""
I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?

Run it back, run it on back
When you're breaking it down for me
'Cause I can hear you two times
Run it on back, will it ever make sense to me?

I got to do things my own way darlin'
Will you ever let me? Will you ever respect me? No

How could you let us down?
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way 'round
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
Worried 'bout every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for

Feel like a brand new person (But you make the same ol' mistakes)
Well, I don't care, I'm in love (Stop before it's too late, I know...)
Feel like a brand new person (But you make the same ol' mistakes)
I finally know what it's like (You don't have what it takes)

Stop while it's not too late (And I still don't know)

Finally taking flight

In this California king bed
We're 10,000 miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart for me

I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped in one with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden, you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shot that spun me around
And now my heart left
I feel so empty and hollow

And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you
You don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame

And now I feel like, oh
You're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it (Do it)

No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P.I.M.P (now shorty)

Now, shorty, she in the club, she dancin' for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce and Gabbana
She feed them foolish fantasies
They pay her, 'cause they want her

I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear sayin' they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar tryin' to get a drink up out her

She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me 'cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga tryna holla 'cause I want some head
I'm that nigga tryna holla 'cause I want some bread

I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch, hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid!
Look, baby, this is simple, you can't see
You fuckin' with me, you fuckin' with a P.I.M.P

I don't know what you heard about me (woo!)
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P.I.M.P

Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood

The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady!

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes

Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick from unda cheese from under my nuts

It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts

Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes

It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
""Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas""
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it ""gifted""
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with

Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack one and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time, you remember the name (Ayy, ayy)

Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail
And livin' reckless, but if you go check my belt
You may see something else I use to protect myself
A vest, to stop a Rueger and deflect the shells
And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel

Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people cross the line

You're there (I need you), ooh I need you (I need you to hate)
Like the fire needs the air (so I can use you for your energy)
I won't burn unless you're there, you're there (you know, this real shit, feel this)

America got a thing for this gangsta shit, they love me
Black Chuckas, black skullies, leather Pelle Pelle
I tag SPIT over Ramo's shit, I'm a vandal
Got that silver duct tape on my trey-eight handle
The women in my life bring confusion and shit
So like Nino in ""New Jack,"" I holla ""Cancel that bitch!""
Look at me, this is the life I chose
Niggas around me so cold, man my heart done froze

I built an empire on the low, the NARC's don't know
I'm the weatherman, I take that cocoa leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the door
O after O, you know?
Homie, I'm just triple beam, dreaming, niggas be scheming
I fiend to live the good life, the fiends are just fiendin'
Conceal my weapon nice and neat so you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me

I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Nigga you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (buck you)

I'll Still Kill,50 Cent feat. Akon,"Oh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood

Oh, and when I hit the block, I still will kill
And I don't want, nigga, but I will if I got to kill
If niggas get to fuckin' around (yeah)
If niggas get to fuckin' around

Respect come from admiration and fear
You can admire me if you can catch one in your wig
You see the Testarossa, the toaster's right on my lap
So if a nigga get out of line, a nigga get clapped
I got an arsenal, a infantry, I'm built for this mentally
That's why I'm the general, I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now, nigga, I'll be the end of you
Forget ya enemies and think of what'cha friends'll do

I drop a bag off, then let a mag off
The Heckler & Koch'll tear half of your ass off
I'm not for the games, I'm not for all the playin'
The hollow tips rain when I unleash the pain
Get the message from the lions or get the message from the nine
Paint a picture wit' words, you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall, nigga, watch me go for mine
I let 21 shots off at the same time, yeah

Oh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothin' changed, still holla at my homies

Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangsta shit
Now Blood walk to this, now Crips walk to this
Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangsta shit

Doors lift up I'm like Go Go Gadget
See the shit I got on, homey I hate too
My teflon arm brought my government issues

I'll hit your vertebrae bullets rip through tissues
Your wife on the futon huggin that skitzo
Homey you a bitch you got feminine ways
Heard you got four lips and bleed for seven days
I got fo' fifths and bananas on the K's
And got more whips than a runaway slave
Me and Yayo go back like some high top fades
When I made fifty mill, Em got paid
When I made sixty mill, Dre got paid
When I made eighty mill, Jimmy got paid
I ain't even gotta rap now life is made
Said I ain't even gotta rap, I'm filthy man

She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her cause they wanna

I spit a little G man, and my game got her
A hour later, have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear saying they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar trying to get a drink up out her

She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga trying to holla cause I want some head
I'm that nigga trying to holla cause I want some bread

I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid
Look baby this is simple, you can't see
You fucking with me, you fucking with a P-I-M-P

But I'll hunt or duck a nigga down like it's sport
Front on me, I'll cut ya, gun-butt ya or bump ya
You getting money? I can't none with ya then fuck ya
I'm not the type to get knocked for D.W.I.
I'm the type that'll kill your connect when the coke price rise
Gangstas, they bump my shit then they know me
I grew up around some niggas that's not my homies

Remember The Name (feat. Eminem & 50 Cent),Ed Sheeran feat. Eminem & 50 Cent,"Yeah, I was born a misfit, grew up ten miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just being on a rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it ""gifted""
My face is going numb from the - the stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my fifteen minutes, I must have missed 'em

20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time, you remember the name (a-ayy, a-ayy)
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time, you remember the name (a-ayy, a-ayy)

Knowing that... if you get knocked
You get fucked in the yard
Youza pop-tart sweetheart
You soft in the middle
I eat ya for breakfast

The watch was an exchange for your necklace
And your boss is a bitch

If he could he would
Sell his soul for cheap
Trade like to be Suge
You can buy cars but you can't buy respect in the hood
Maybe I'm so disrespectful cuz to me you're a mystery
I know niggas from your hood

You have no history
Never poked nothing
Never popped nothing
Nigga stop frontin
Jay put you on

X made you hot
Now you run around like you some big shot

Confusion occurs comin' up in a cold world
Daddy ain't around probably out commitin' felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing ch-check out my melody
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope for a fo-finger ring
one of them gold ropes
nana told me if I pass could get a sheep skin coat
If I can move a few packs i'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep at night
Woke up the next morning niggas done stole my bike
Different day same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop

Go 'head envy me
I'm raps MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere so you can get to know me

Hate it or love it the underdog's on top

First mixtape song i inherited beef for ya
Gritted my teeth for ya

Put Compton on my back when you was in need of soldiers
At my last show I threw away my NWA gold and
Had the whole crowd yellin ""Free Yayo""
So Niggas betta get up outta mine
Fo' I creep and turn yo' projects into columbine
And I'm rap's MVP
Don't make me remind y'all what happened to DC
This nigga ain't Gotti
He pretend
He mad at us cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend
And it seems yo' little rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly south

When the doubts was out who gave the west coast mouth to mouth

Out the headache an stress you done been through before

That he does it with the best, runs a lil' less
Tatted on his chest (uh huh)
I like it (so what), I like it

Just wait and see (but they don't know me)

Shell hit my jaw, I ain't wait for doctor to get it out
Hit my wisdom tooth, spit it out

Got a purple heart for war, and I ain't never left the City
Hoes be like ""Fitty, you so witty""
On the dick like they heard I ghostwrite for P.Diddy

Either he is or he ain't your man (haha)
Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend

First we get the talkin', then we get the touchin'
If we get past the phone games we'll be -
I kiss like the French then put my tongue in your ear
Do it like the dogs do it girl and pull on your hair
For me a different scenery just means a different position
In the tub or on the sink, I improvise now listen
In the chopper or on the jet, join the mile high club
I'm no fool I know money can't buy me love (haha)

You said that I could call you whenever I needed someone to listen to me
That's why I'm here standin' by your side 'cause you always come through for me
So many others tried to be where you are but they just wanted to do me
But you took your time and now I'm satisfied that's why I want you all to me

I'm the hitmaker y'all depend on
Backstage in my city, it was friendzone
You won't ever take no chain off of us
How the fuck you big-steppin' with a size-seven men's on?

This the bark with the bite, nigga, what's up?
I know my picture on the wall when y'all cook up
Extortion baby, whole career, you been shook up
'Cause Top told you, ""Drop and give me 50,"" like some push-ups, huh

Your last one bricked, you really not on shit
They make excuses for you 'cause they hate to see me lit
Pull your contract 'cause we gotta see the split
The way you doin' splits, bitch, your pants might rip

You better do that motherfuckin' show inside the bity
Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty
Then we need a verse for the Swifties
Top say drop, you better drop and give 'em 50

Pipsqueak, pipe down
You ain't in no big three, SZA got you wiped down
Travis got you wiped down, Savage got you wiped down

You might think I've taken some lumps
Only if we talkin' 'bout sums (yeah)
Intentions are pure, they cannot tell me relax
My mentions are jokes, but they never give me the facts
This isn't that, can't be ignorin' the stats
Based off of that, they gotta run me the max
They gotta run me the max, they gotta double the racks
They had it set up for real, but they didn't come with the slaps

When I heard the shit I was skippin' through that
If I get it trippin', it's no comin' back
I don't understand, these niggas gotta adapt
You know where I'm at, I put the 6 on the map
Your shorty was bent, she wanted to vent

I gotta be single for a while, you can't control me
Uno, dos, tres, in a race, they can't hold me
And I show my face in a case so you know it's me
Imitation isn't flattery, it's just annoyin' me
And I'm too about it
And the dirt that they threw on my name
Turned to soil and I grew up out it
Time for y'all to figure out what y'all gon' do about it
Big wheels keep rollin', rollin'

I'm outside, twenty-nine, G5, seaside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
But honestly that sound like a fair trade to me
If I ever hurt one and I'm still here
Outside, frontline, Southside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
Honestly that sound like a fair trade to me

Look, don't invite me over if you throw another pity party
Lookin' back, it's hard to tell you where I started
I don't know who love me, but I know that it ain't everybody
I can never love her, she a busy body
Baby, if you want me, can't be turnin' up with everybody, nah
Can't be fuckin' on just anybody, yeah

Champagne Poetry,Drake,"I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I, until I
I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I find the only words I know that you

I've been hot since the birth of my son
I remain unfazed, trust worse has been done
Man, fuck evaluation, show me personal funds
It's the pretty boys versus the petty boys
Sold out already got a whole new set of toys
Shit is so surreal, Drizzy Drake, you better enjoy
Nothing else bigger than the OVO letterman boys
Cashmere knits for the nighttime boat rides
Oli got the first edition parked up roadside
The only sign of struggling is coming from those guys
I'm trying to just relate what I can see through my own eyes

And nothing tell the truth like the eyes will
Lived so much for others, don't remember how I feel
Friends in high places and friends that I hide still
Still managed to moonwalk straight through a minefield
(The only words I know that you)
And then I come back to tell you how that feels
Built this house for us all, pain in my back still
You niggas gassed up, you couldn't pay the (until I, until I)

I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I, until I
I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I find the only words I know that you

Champagne poetry, these are the effortless flows
Supposedly something else is controlling me
Under a picture lives some of the greatest quotes from me
Under me, I see all the people that claim they over me
And above me, I see nobody
I'd have to be dead for them to say you took it from me
The 20 percent of you that we own is my tootsie's money

Now, what the hell are you waitin' for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise
Get 'em Jay!

Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah, hearin' me rap is like hearin' G rap in his prime
I'm Young H.O., rap's grateful dead
'Bout to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect

On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin', grand closin'
Goddamn, your man Hov' cracked the can open again

Love All (with JAY-Z),Drake feat. JAY-Z,"Previously on Ready To Die

Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P.
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason
Loyalty is priceless and it's all I need
Can't burn a bridge just to light my way
Lotta '42 on the flights I'm taking
Pouring out my soul and it might sound crazy
Lotta falling outs help me build foundation
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P.
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason

Never had a lot, this is all I need
Lost individuals is all I see
Grab the top spot like ""pardon my reach""
Woke up one day and it was all on me
If it comes down, it's gon' fall on me
Lotta '42 on the flights I'm taking
Long way down from the heights I'm chasing
Just touched down, I was lights out in Vegas

Girls checking in 'cause my lifestyle dangerous
Hard to tell people that I'm all out of favors
Call me for songs or they call me for paper
Turning off my phone for the night now, baby
Pouring out my soul and it might sound crazy

Why I Love You,Jay-Z & Kanye West feat. Mr Hudson,"Ooh, I love you so

Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know

Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know

Picture if you will that the throne is burning, Rome is burning
And I'm sitting in the corner all alone burning
Why does it always end up like this? Something that we don't determine
Same people that I fought for, that I fight for
That I ride for, that I live for, that I die for
Be the reason that these niggas is alive for
And they want me dead, but I'm so sorry, but I just can't die for you
But I can make 'em put their hands in the sky for you
We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th

Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for
When the grief is over, beef is over, I'll be fly when Easter's over
I tried to teach niggas how to be kings
And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers

Otis,Jay-Z & Kanye West feat. Otis Redding,"It makes it easier, easier to bear

Some girls they don't forget it
Love is their only happiness, yeah
Squee-, squee-, squee- (sounds so soulful, don't you agree?)
Squeeze her, don't tease her (ow!) Never leave her

Uh, I invented swag
Poppin' bottles, puttin' supermodels in the cab
Proof
I guess I got my swagger back, truth
New watch alert, Hublot's
Or the big-face Rollie, I got two of those
Arm out the window, through the city I maneuver slow
Cock back, snap back, see my cut through the holes, Hov

Damn, Yeezy and Hov, where the hell you been?
Niggas talkin' real reckless, stuntmen
I adopted these niggas, Phillip Drummond 'em
Now I'm 'bout to make 'em tuck they whole summer in

They ain't see me 'cause I pulled up in my other Benz

4:44,Jay-Z,"Do I find it so hard
When I know in my heart
I'm letting you down every day
Letting you down every day
Why do I keep on running away?

Look, I apologize, often womanize
Took for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song, I don't deserve you
I harassed you out in Paris
""Please come back to Rome,"" you make it home

We talked for hours when you were on tour
""Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone!""
I said, ""Don't embarrass me,"" instead of ""Be mine""
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your 21st birthday

You matured faster than me, I wasn't ready
So I apologize
I seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn this death and
I apologize for all the stillborns 'cause I wasn't present
Your body wouldn't accept it

No Church In the Wild,Jay-Z & Kanye West feat. Frank Ocean,"Human beings in a mob

What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer?
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive?
Alright, alright
No church in the wild

Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in the Rolls-Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hiding from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached

Drug dealer chic
I'm wondering if a thug's prayers reach
Is Pius pious 'cause God loves pious?
Socrates asks, ""Whose bias do y'all seek?""
All for Plato, screech
I'm out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy, laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats

What niggas gon' do, Hov?
This the new crack on a new stove
I'm in the two-door, true that
Niggas tellin' me ""You back?""

Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch, huh?
And if life a bitch, bet she suck my dick, huh?
And I bet she fucked the whole clique, huh
By the way nigga, you should fuckin' quit, nigga
Just forget it, you talk it, I live it
Like Eli, I did it, joke's on you motherfucker, and I get it
No paper hoe, but you can have some more of me
Or-a-gy or are we speaking metaphorically?

Historically, I'm kickin' bitches out like pam, nigga
Goin' H.A.M. nigga, me and Jigga
And a nigga still young, why I have no kids
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit
Had a few white girls, asses flat as shit
But the head so good, damn a nigga glad he hit
Got 'em jumpin' out the building

And I'll never let my son have an ego
He'll be nice to everyone, wherever we go
I mean, I might even make 'em be Republican
So everybody know he love white people
And I'll never let him leave his college girlfriend
And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
And I'll never let him ever hit the telethon
I mean even if people dyin', and the world ends

See, I just want him to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life
Just want him to be someone people like
Don't want him to be hated, all the time judged
Don't be like your daddy that would never budge

Who Gon Stop Me,JAY-Z feat. Kanye West,"I can't stop

I can't stop

Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
'Til I die I'ma fuckin' ball
Now who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me, huh?
Who gon' stop me?
Who gon' stop me, huh?

Black cards, black cars
Black on black, black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for?

Who gon' stop me, huh?

Who gon' stop me, huh?
Yeah, who gon' stop me?
No brakes, I need, State Farm
So many watches, I need eight arms
One neck but got eight charms
Who gon' stop me, huh?

Niggas talking, they bitch-made, ix-nay off my dicks-nay
That's pig latin, itch-bay
Who gon' stop me, huh?
Last night ain't go so well
Got kicked up out the hotel
Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert
Yes! Tell Howard Cosell
You just a commentator, if you getting paper
Everybody I know from the hood got common haters

In some relations, you just supposed to say none
Heard she fucked the doorman
Well, that's cool, I fucked the waitress
Heard Yeezy was racist, well, I guess that's on one basis
I only like green faces

Umbrella - Radio Edit,Rihanna feat. JAY-Z,"Yeah, Rihanna
Good Girl Gone Bad
Take three, action

Hov, no clouds in my storms
Let it rain, I hydroplane into fame
Comin' down like the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone

We Roc-A-Fellas
We fly higher than weather
And she flies it better

You know me, in anticipation for precipitation
Stack chips for the rainy day
Jay, Rain Man is back with Little Miss Sunshine
Rihanna, where you at?

You had my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star
Baby 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share

Because when the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end

Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella

Super Bowl goals
My wife in the crib feedin' the kids liquid gold
We in a whole different mode
The kid that used to pitch bricks can't be pigeonholed
I cooked up more chicken when the kitchen closed

Uh, we gon' reach a billi' first
I told my wife the spiritual shit really work
Alhamdulillah, I run through 'em all
Hovi's home, all these phonies come to a halt
All this old talk left me confused
You'd rather be old rich me or new you?
And old niggas, y'all stop actin' brand new
Like 2Pac ain't have a nose ring too, huh

Nobody wins when the family feuds
But my stash can't fit into Steve Harvey's suit
I'm clear why I'm here, how about you?
Ain't no such thing as an ugly billionaire, I'm cute
(Mmm) pretty much
If anybody gettin' handsome checks, it should be us

Fuck rap, crack cocaine
Nah, we did that, Black-owned things

Niggas watchin' the throne, very happy to be
Power to the people, when you see me, see you

And I'm from the murder capital where they murder for capital
Heard about at least three killings this afternoon
Looking at the news like, ""Damn, I was just with him after school""
No shop class, but half the school got a tool
And a ""I could die any day"" type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue
It's time for us to stop and re-define Black power
41 souls murdered in 50 hours

The paper read, ""Murder
Black-on-Black murder""
The paper read, ""Murder

Fast when it comes to the gas

By no means average

You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day it's just so grey and black

Hope, I just need a ray of that
'Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for 'em
They just say it's wack, but they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin' you
It's dark, let me turn on the lights
And brighten me and enlighten you

I don't think you realise what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue, 'cause me and you were like a crew
I was like your sidekick, you gon' either wanna fight
When I get off this fuckin' mic, or you gon' hug me
But I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do 'cause

Ten million, that's a must, livin' in California

Everybody wanna visit for women (weed and weather)
They come for (women, weed, and weather)

From all around the world for (the women, weed, and weather)

How the fuck y'all can't see I ride, when I drive, down the block, and you look outside
H-A-T-E in yo' eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
It's a beautiful day, I guess, for a bitch to roll wit' Andre, I guess
Roll it up, baby, come and lift that dress, then roll it up for me when I'm stressed

You might catch me in Atlanta lookin' like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi-Town I be really pimpin'
But nothin' like my hometown I'm forever livin'

Ribbon in the sky on the radio, 'cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California livin' 'til I am old

Crack a Bottle (feat. Dr. Dre & 50 Cent),Eminem feat. Dr. Dre & 50 Cent,"Oh, ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and four murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady!

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes

Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

(Okay, let's go)
Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick from unda cheese from under my nuts

It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts

Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes

It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

Still, niggas run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple, so call me Clearasil
I wipe niggas off the face of the Earth since birth
I been a bad nigga, now let me tell you what I'm worth

More than a stealth bomber, I cause drama
The enforcer, music flows like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes panties wet

The mic gets smoked, once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick

For my niggas drinking Cognac, smoking weed, always pack
More than one firearm, chrome rims, riding on
Chronic in your system, let me know my shit's the bomb

Fuck a bitch, don't tease, bitch, striptease, bitch

Gobble and swallow a nut up, shut up and get my cash (cash)

Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach
With a batch of them banging Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthing this gangsta rap
It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch, I'm from

Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style
Know that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?
Whatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ah, put the pussy in a sarcophagus

You escaped what I escape
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too

So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning

'Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus

She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve

And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from outta town, I like to show her off

My pen's better, you don't write, trendsetter, you clone-like
Pay homage or K's vomit, ungrateful niggas, I don't like

A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like

They smile in my face is what I don't like
They steal your whole sound that's a soundbite
The media crucify me like they did Christ
They want to find me not breathin' like they found Mike
A girl'll run her mouth only out of spite
But I never hit a woman never in my life
I was in too deep like Mekhi Phifer
In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice
Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice
Eatin' good, vegetarian with the brown rice
Girls kissin' girls, 'cause it's hot right?
But unless they use a strap-on then they not dykes
They ain't about that life, they ain't about that life
We hangin' out that window, it's about to be a Suge night

Five hunnid, then promise she gon' pay you back tomorrow
Then left with a scammer with a Gucci hat from Marshall's
Slept with him, then woke up, saw his watch was a Fossil
Everybody wear a costume, spray a little extra perfume
YEEZYS in the stock room, that's the name, make the stock boom
Hit the club with at least ten, you in a 500, that's a cheap Benz
I promise Playboi we get the tape out 'fore the weekend
It's over, too famous to sneak in
Wolverine in a sheep skin, I be goin' off the deep end

Picture if you will that the throne is burning, Rome is burning
And I'm sitting in the corner all alone burning
Why does it always end up like this? Something that we don't determine
Same people that I fought for, that I fight for
That I ride for, that I live for, that I die for
Be the reason that these niggas is alive for
And they want me dead, but I'm so sorry, but I just can't die for you
But I can make 'em put their hands in the sky for you
We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th

Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for
When the grief is over, beef is over, I'll be fly when Easter's over
I tried to teach niggas how to be kings
And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers

Squeeze her, don't tease her (ow!) Never leave her

Uh, I invented swag
Poppin' bottles, puttin' supermodels in the cab
Proof
I guess I got my swagger back, truth
New watch alert, Hublot's
Or the big-face Rollie, I got two of those
Arm out the window, through the city I maneuver slow
Cock back, snap back, see my cut through the holes, Hov

Damn, Yeezy and Hov, where the hell you been?
Niggas talkin' real reckless, stuntmen
I adopted these niggas, Phillip Drummond 'em
Now I'm 'bout to make 'em tuck they whole summer in
They say I'm crazy, well, I'm 'bout to go dumb again
They ain't see me 'cause I pulled up in my other Benz

But who will lean if I fall? But never mind, I'm fly, you know

She the type to seek love and make it everlasting
I'm the type to wake up and say you never happened
I mean I fucked the girl with hella passion
But it's cold how we smashing
Left her sleeping on a separate mattress
I think her body makes for better practice
Good excuse for my absence like ""Flacko, where your ass been?""
Heard you done with fashion, now yo' ass is acting
I'm tripping off the acid, now yo' ass is looking massive
This ain't the shit equipped with columns from my reckless swagging
This that dark house party with this record blasting
Rolling spliffs, clique beside me, fingers Liberace
When I seen this bitch in Venice, Tommy and some mean Huaraches
I'm all alone though, mood music makes me bop slower
Trippin' on how I shifted pop culture
Changed Hip-Hop on ya, smoking like a Rasta was my pop's culture
I be damned if I die sober
I'll be sure to visit Pac for ya

And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothing at all

It's your boy Kanye to the
Chi-Town, what's going on?
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk

How do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her, her son's on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till

She was with me before the deal she been tryna be mine
She a delta so she been throwing that dynasty sign
No use me tryna be lying
I've been trying to be signed
Trying to be a millionaire
How I used two lifelines?

Saint Pablo,Kanye West,"Yeah, 9:08 L.A. time
Back in the lab and shit

My wife said, I can't say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon' both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no

People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter
My friends' best advice was to stay low
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll

The media said it was outlandish spendin'
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in they control

I know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive

Thank God For Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with with no permission, on our own conditions
Most Blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25

Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky

I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random

But we stay winnin', this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy endin' and a new beginnin'
And a new fitted, and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied 'til all my niggas get it, get it?

Ain't no question, if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly driftin' away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playin'? I'm sayin'
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missin'

Used to be a high roller but I skated on him
When he went away, then I just waited on him
Came back, then I got X-rated on him

Never (ah-ah), never hesitated on him
Even though I had to go up, elevated on him
Had the trap house, but it got raided on him
But I kept it real, player, never traded on him, uh

I mean, I wouldn't call 'em mini-me's
More like some rusty, dusty, raggedy-ass enemies
I mean one thing for sure, ain't no forgettin' me

What is the hurry? It's pretty early
It's okay, we'll take our time

The night is still young
The night is still young
The night is still young
And so are we
The night is still young (how dare we sit quietly?)
The night is still young (and watch the world pass us by?)
The night is still young (how dare we sit quietly?)
So are we

Ayo, drinks on you or the drinks is on me?

I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend
I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King

And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street
How I go from bars on the screen, though, to the TV screen?
Don't ask me, but never change the channel
Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals
Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake
Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle
My lil' hoe out Atlanta, got a hoe out Atlanta
With a hoe out Atlanta, she a hoe out Atlanta

Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale, but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due, but you always get it done
Might've been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you've always been the one

One, I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe it's just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you wanna have no sex, why you wanna protest
Why you wanna fight for your right
'Cause you don't love them boys
Pussy run e'rything, fuck that noise

I know things get hard, but girl, you got it, girl, you got it, there you go
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine

We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed

We don't snatch chains, we find out addresses
And we don't leave messes

Hình bóng ai đó nhẹ nhàng vụt qua nơi đây
Quyến rũ ngây ngất loạn nhịp làm tim mê say
Cuốn lấy áng mây theo cơn sóng xô dập dìu
Nụ cười ngọt ngào cho ta tan vào phút giây miên man quên hết con đường về eh

Chẳng thể tìm thấy lối về eh
(Let me know your name)
Điệu nhạc hòa quyện trong ánh mắt đôi môi
Dẫn lối những bối rối rung động khẽ lên ngôi
(Và rồi khẽ, và rồi khẽ khẽ)

Chạm nhau mang vô vàn
Đắm đuối vấn vương dâng tràn
Lấp kín chốn nhân gian
Làn gió hoá sắc hương mơ màng
Một giây ngang qua đời
Cất tiếng nói không nên lời
Ấm áp đến trao tay ngàn sao trời lòng càng thêm chơi vơi
Dịu êm không gian bừng sáng
Đánh thức muôn hoa mừng
Quấn quít hát ngân nga từng chút níu bước chân em dừng
Bao ý thơ tương tư ngẩn ngơ
Lưu dấu nơi mê cung đẹp thẫn thờ

Hãy trao cho anh
Hãy trao cho anh
Hãy trao cho anh thứ anh đang mong chờ
Hãy trao cho anh
Hãy trao cho anh
Hãy mau làm điều ta muốn vào khoảnh khắc này đê
Hãy trao cho anh đê!
Hãy trao cho anh đê!

Bumpin these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life

Fresh out of jail, life's Hell for a black, celebrity

Okay, and who are you here to see?
Uh, Snoop Dogg? Says here ""Snoop D-o-g-g
Oh, yeah, he's right down the hall, first door to your right
Give him a knock and he should be right with you
Thanks, it's uh, this door right here, right?
Mm-hmm
Thank you

Grab a seat
Thanks I'm Dave very nice to meet
Dave, what it do? You can call me Dogg
Let me just check your sheet
No problem, sir, let me just say
I'm a big fan of the shit that y'all make
I can't lie, I been thinking about this all day
All good, there's a reason that we called, Dave
Let me start with your background
Where you come from?

Sure, I was undergrad down there in Richmond
Before that
Oh, you talking 'bout my hometown?
Yeah
I was born out of Philly grew up in a little silly old town called Cheltenham
It's in the suburbs, upper-middle wealth around
So real shit you ain't never had to struggle for much
I wouldn't say it like that, we just had a different kind of trap

Elaborate
Well I ain't never had a tool, but I had to be the man at school
Like I was doing shit I had to do
So when I finished undergrad, I'm cool
And I can get whatever job I wanted
But the job you wanted wasn't all that bumping
Yeah, and I saw it quick all the flaws that be coming
When you grow up like that
Know you been racing them rats, you ain't been making them raps

Boo hoo what a hardship
How you paid to get the rap shit started?
Man, my Bar Mitzvah money
But don't diss me buddy
I wasn't one of them youngins up on the block who had nothing to lose
I must've wanted this a lot, I had something to choose
Look at that, I can say there's something to prove up in your ass
Yeah, I guess
That's enough of the past, what makes you want to do rap?

Oh my God, it's the best
Bitches let me draw up on their breasts
Literally I can reinvent myself
I got a forum to project myself
It's never boring, every morning I wake up and try to best myself
I never got to be suppressed or stealthy to express myself
It's kinda healthy
Cool, now let me put you through a couple hypotheticals
Sure

In a club and a couple niggas threaten you
Uh, I wouldn't do shit
And I don't even get what that got to do with this?
Shut the fuck up, rap's like life
If you wanna do this, then you won't get far acting like a little bitch
Nah, that's my niche!
Don't get offended by this, but that's the market y'all missed
That's the target I'll hit
And that's the heart of my pitch

I know that I'm beneficial
I can't show no feelings
Bentley windows tinted
Nowadays ain't no time for me to kick it
Business too intensive
They gone say that I been actin' different
I'm beyond, they mental
I moved on from slanging drugs and pistols
Can't be thinking simple

Tighten up my circle
Someone in my camp been leaking info
The Maybach triple black, the shit relaxing
Feel like I'm in a limo
I pull through the hood 2 let them see
I let down all the windows
I know I'm the motivation
They see me they see a hero

Lot of niggas rich, but it hit different
When you come from zero
They know I bang C's
But everyday I need a different B roll
Super superstitious
Ask my niggas, I still pick up pennies
You can't give attention to these bitches
When your name get mentioned

If i don't kill him, he gone be in critical condition
When I'm finished with him
Some shit just can't faze you when you been that nigga

Look at my ankle, look at my wrist
This one a pack, this one a brick
That one an opp, that one a lick
This one for Pop, this one for Juice
I am the one, bitch, you a deuce, brr

Niggas give it up in my city
Really shed blood in my city, real love in my city
Niggas'll son your whole set like it's a round six
Clips, whole team get flyer than round trips, bitch
She's still spying on my flicks (flicks), he admiring my drip (drip)

Check what I do, the check'll clear too

Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down

The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping

My people them steady trapping, and they still be getting active

Least that's what my mom says
Proof is in the progress, money's not a object
Busy than a m-, you know how my job get
Barkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get
Haven't fallen off yet, yee

Come with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature
Deposit the money to Brenda, LaTisha or Linda, Felicia
She came for me twice, I didn't even nut for her once, you know I'm a pleaser
42 millimeter was made in Geneva
Yeah, I probably should go to Yeshiva, we went to Ibiza
Yeah, I probably should go link with Yeezy

Never Sleep (with Lil Baby feat. Travis Scott),NAV feat. Lil Baby & Travis Scott,"Tay Keith, this too hard

Geeked, never sleep
Stretch a hundred to millions in weeks

Don't you tell him you got it from me
After this, I'ma need therapy
I been buildin' up my legacy
Hundreds on hundreds, on fold
I been up so far, somewhere
Stuck at the top and it's nowhere to go

I was just thinkin' like, ""Damn, might get a new drop so I can circle the floor""
I was just thinkin' like, ""Damn, some niggas got cropped, I got a circle to grow""
Soon as we land, we make it go ""Pop""
Gave her a grand, she turn it to snot
Got with her man, a nigga got blocked
Gave her a tan, I'm already hot
I gave her the land, the sand, and all the views, and really all you did was plot
I gave you the plans and brands and all the jewels, and really all you did was flop

Geeked, never sleep
Stretch a hundred to millions in weeks

Hurricane,Kanye West feat. The Weeknd & Lil Baby,"See this in 3D, all lights out for me
All lights out for me, lightning strikes the beach
80 degrees, warm it up for me

Thousand miles from shore, I can float on the water
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
I know you won't

Yeah, walkin' on the bridge, I threw my sins over the deep end
Sippin' 'til my stomach hurt, this month I done lost three friends
Early mornin', brainstormin', normally I can't sleep in
Sometimes I just wanna restart it, but it all depends
If I'ma be that same young, hungry — from West End
Wrote my hardest wrongs and the crazy part, I ain't have no pen
Maybach interior came with sheepskin
Still remember when I just had three bands
Now I'm the one everyone call on 'cause I got deep pants
Bro told me to wait to beat the game, it's only defense and
Never fazed by names that they might call me, but they gon' respect
And I feel like you better off tryin' to call

I hope you're okay
But you're the reason
And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?

And for a fortnight there
We were forever
Run into you sometimes
Ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard
Turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers
I want to kill her.

All my mornings are Mondays
Stuck in an endless February
I took the miracle move-on-drug
The effects were temporary

Am I honest still? Am I half the man I used to be?
I doubt it, forget about it, whatever
And the dial tone is all I have

I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown
In the name of someone I no longer know
For the shame of being young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and the transmitter radio

I don't like it when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emergency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
Run away, but we're running in circles

I'm waiting on you again

Like nobody ever could

And you know I stay trippin', am I crazy? Oh, no
I'm stickin' with my baby, for sure
Together or solo

Do you want to know me?

Stuck in Nintendo, you're the controller
Street Fighters and such

I yelled ""finish him""
Come Desdemona, Othello and tragedies
Shakespearean sorrows, where do I begin?

Got my mind right, hit her back, brrr, the wrong line

Dark shades, 'cause I'm stone crazy
Girl, we grown, stop playing on my phone, baby

All your childish attempts to make me angry fall short
Which only fuels the rage you have, because you have nothing
Understandable, I'm shining brilliant with five Brazilians
There were times I used to hide my feelings
Now I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini
And motherfuckers can't see me
Wait 'til this chick see me on TV, I make this shit look easy

Cigarette-stained smile, all covered in sin

Some days I hold a grudge, some days I Holy Ghost her
Some days I just ghost her, some days I'm supposed to
The crib feel like a gunfight, but them strollers, that's the holster (huh)
We can make amends over old memes and mimosas

My mama know I ain't make my bed, but I'ma lay in it
Whether it's sandpaper, suede linen
Whether I'm alone or Creole lady marmalade-ing it
The same pajamas I was afraid in, I boogeyman slayed
My blankets concealed my blade in it, emotional seesaw
With two fat motherfuckers with strong knees in free fall (huh)
It's cloudy with a chance of meatballs, I checked the weather
I gave all my vices a call, let's get together

To talk about the highs and lows, the ups and downs
The friends that I had to hide to come around
They told me that I knew you'd always come around
Come around, come around, come around, come around
To work out the highs and lows, the ups and downs
No need to hide disguises comin' down
Go and get high, I promise you're comin' down

The same summer that widowed Gwyneth Paltrow
Back when I could trust in my dogs like Balto
My family The Sopranos these niggas is altos
First album, every track could be the outro
Velcro to shelltoes, things that we will outgrow
Used to rock South Pole, summers taking the six bus to South Shore
Never sold out but now we out-sold

That was the summer I learned to love the great outdoors
Learned you get the fans if you can't keep yo' mouth closed
That summer left a couple marcks like Groucho

You can die today, it ain't gon' save me nothin' but drama (super)

Workin' on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual (like usual)
Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up (turnt up)

Help me fight my demons off, know the usual
I had put a chopper in her name and a Ruger
She hang on the block where I hang like a shooter

Throwed away a cougar, she didn't wanna leave
Treat her like garbage, my heart was on my sleeve
Should've chose better with your company at least
Why should I have love for her if she ain't get it out the creek?
Why should I have trust for you, you ain't get it out the creek?
Why should I have love for you, you ain't kneelin' to my feet?
Why should I be carin' when I know I can't be beat?
See how the ice be glarin' when I come through and retrieve

It's easy to know it's us if a body in the street
Too turned up and the plug talk Swahili
After I pay my taxes, I go Richard Mille
In another tax bracket, you niggas beneath me

Who causin' a racket in Jamaica on the weekend?
Half a ticket on vacation, I ripped up the receipt
And she call me daddy 'cause my money long like Stevie
Stay down with my son, right or wrong, FBG shit (Freebandz)

How you gon' be gang? You bang if you rich, what's in your bloodline?
Come in with some Talibans, everythin' gettin' gunned down
Halloween gang in this bitch, shit gettin' scary
Three hundred thousand for the cheapest ring, cost a Bentley truck, I'm legendary, lil' bitch

Hot, off the thermometer, lil' bitch
Hotter than fish grease, lil' bitch
My ring cost a big VS, blown as my wrist
I'm gettin' money like this, can't tell problems exist

I wake up fresh every day like I'm goin' to take a pic
Hermes hit my main line 'cause they know I'm lit
Stuffed a hundred-fifty racks in your purse, lil' bitch
And when I wake up, go surf in your pussy, hit

Throw it like that video, wanted that for a long time
Cool with it I get it though

My teacher always used to tell me, ""You gon' lose, nigga""

That's why I never went to school, nigga
And why I'm rappin' like I got somethin' to prove, nigga
Went and bought the mansion wit' the pool in it
Billy with the stamp, I get two wit' it

Move wit' it 'cause these niggas wanna take my life
No weapon formed against me, every time I pray at night
Scoopin' thotties in the Phantom, that's the way of life
And make 'em fuck their best friends like they was dykes

Reachin' for the Glock, every time I play the light
I'm on 12 o'clock every time I play them bikes
I'm with the pack, uh, gettin' back, yeah
Spend dope, nigga, sellin' smack, gang

Wins & Losses,Meek Mill,"You have to eat the dream
You have to sleep the dream

You gotta touch
You have to see it when nobody else sees it
You have to feel it when it's not tangible
You have to believe it when you cannot see it
You gotta be possessed with the dream

Yeah, any weapon formed against us shall not prosper
Young nigga started with oodles and noodles, now we eating lobster

As I walk through the valley with my ladder in flex
I'm the realest nigga in it, I just happen to rap
When they all thought we was finished, they was laughing at that
So I went and bought me a Dawn and flipped that hat to the back
Fuck 'em
New jewelry, new whips on the way now
Brr, brr, that's yo bitch on the way now
Mama told me if you fall, never stay down

Pain Away (feat. Lil Durk),Meek Mill feat. Lil Durk,"Yeah, woo

We was in the trenches, tryna get it out the mud

Sold the Richard Porter, I just want to feel the love
I feel like a Crip 'cause I can't even trust my blood (Blood)
Loyalty, (You know what loyalty is?), I say, ""Spoil me""
You ain't my dawg, you fallin' out about no lawyer fee (No lawyer fee)
You had a brick and I ain't even have a quarter key
You never seen my hand out, I knew it was more to me
It's more than us to see our sons and all our daughters eat
'Cause I got cops tryna lock me, opps tryna slaughter me
But I stay prayed up, loadin' all these K's up
'Cause I ain't get advicе from all them nights back when I stayed up
Don't hit mе about no show if you ain't came to set the stage up
We God body, threw a thousand shots, they barely grazed us
And I can't let 'em make my grave up

Ambition - feat. Meek Mill & Rick Ross,Wale,"The time is now, on e'rything
Took my heart away from money
I ain't interested in fame
And I pray that never change
Ambition is priceless
It's something that's in your veins
And I put that on my name

Uh, only hope I had was selling dope
Was on my grind 'cause times was harder than a cellar floor
My momma taught me never steal and never tell on folks
I grew up looking up to niggas that was selling coke
Oh, I was raised by the stop sign
No religion, I was getting saved by the Glock 9
By the minute, I was getting paid like a hot line
Serving raw, fiends was calling, we was dot com

Well connected, well respected and well protected
Ain't get accepted, was rejected, and now they regret it
Ain't get my message, was no signal when I was texting
The niggas I was calling was fraud and I learned my lesson
Now I move with aggression, use my mind as a weapon
'Cause chances are never given, they tooken like interceptions
So throw that pass, I'll be the cornerback
Me and Folarin MMG gon' bring that Warner back

For my ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
They gon' love me for my ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it

Jump Out the Face (feat. Future),Meek Mill feat. Future,"I just took a Perc' now I'm on another level
Tasting on the molly got me dancing with the devil
Poured 8th for Kobe Bryant mixing purple with the yellow
Got these racks on me now, it's hard to keep this shit together

Jump out the 'Rari then jump out the Wraith
Then I hop in Margiela then hop in some Bape
They jump out the face
They jump out the face
Money gon' stack and this money gon' fall though

Came from the hood now we jump out of states
Peep all these diamonds they jump out the face
Ducking them diamonds and selling this white
Gotta watch for these niggas they'll jump on your case
(You watch all these niggas, these niggas ain't playing)
And none of this money don't come out the safe
Fuck with my dawg, knock a chunk out ya face
Nigga I be so high, I could jump out to space

When they killed my nigga Snupe I seen my young nigga
In the casket he ain't even have no blood in him
Prolly the reason why I keep taking these drugs quicker
Ain't got no patience for these motherfuckin' fuck niggas
I watch everybody change, they thought I lost it
But now they all bustin' U-ies its goin' cost 'em

I seen Chino shut the casket on the coffin (Truce)
Killed his only big brother and we lost him
So I'ma hold it down 'til we all win
We've been at the clear port ballin'
I just want to see my niggas flossin'
Hundred bands everytime I walk in

If you keep it trill you'll get a blessing for it
Deep down in the trenches with that Wesson on me
My mama, she can't sleep, I come here early mornings (mama)

Any weapon formed against me shall not prosper
Used to pray them Ramen noodles turned to lobster

Nigga tried to peep through the backyard

I got my mama a black card, yeah, I really put on for the head knock
This that 1AC, you ain't one of them rappers
And none of your steppers can step with my steppers
This chess, not checkers
I told my dawgs, ""Don't stress, don't rush it,"" I really got off
It's seven on seven and I'm gettin' better and better
And better, my nigga, it's never no pressure (let's get it)
Every time I hit up one of y'all
Niggas with smoke, it's never no pressure
Niggas is pussy
If I put a price on your head, shit, I get the special
You know I be hangin' wit' Jews
Get money wit' Russians, I'm makin' my moves
The hood behind me, I never could lose, I'm good, I'm solid
Can't play me like one of them dudes
You probably end up on the news

What's Free (feat. Rick Ross & Jay Z),Meek Mill feat. JAY Z & Rick Ross,"You know what free is nigga?

What's free?
Free is when nobody else could tell us what to be
Free is when the TV ain't controllin' what we see
Told my niggas ""I need you""
Through all the fame you know I stay true
Pray my niggas stay free
Made a few mistakes but this ain't where I wanna be
Before I'm judged by 12, put a 12 on my feet
Told my niggas, ""I need you""
Stay up I know these times ain't true
Real life, stay free

Since a lad, I was cunning
Just got a pad out in London
I keep stackin' my money
I need a ladder by summer
AK shots, niggas duckin' stray shots
Been a Top Dawg, that's before the K.Dots
Crackin' in '06, immaculate showmanship
Talk it like you Mitch, disastrous on the strip
Holdin' on your bitch, coulda never sold you a brick
With them people you never been on a list
Mona Lisa to me ain't nothin' but a bitch
Hanging pictures like niggas swinging from his dick
We so different you thought these didn't exist
The Megalodon never seen on his wrist
I'm from the South where they never make it this rich
God is the greatest, but Satan been on his shit
Walkin' the pavement, I pray I'm illuminated
Over a decade and never nobody's favorite
Pot and kilo go hand in hand like we gamblin' huf
My amigo, a million grams and we countin' 'em up
You was dead broke, I let you hold a pack
You paid for it, but I fucked
Around and stole the track
Screaming ""gang gang"" now you wanna rap
Racketeering charges caught him on a tap
Lookin' for a bond lawyers wanna tax
Purple hair got them faggots on your back

Whats free?
Free is when nobody else could tell us what to be
Free is when the TV ain't controlling what we see
Told my niggas ""I need you""
Through all the fame you know I stay true
Pray my niggas stay free
Made a few mistakes but this ain't where I wanna be
Before I'm judged by 12, put a 12 on my feet
Told my niggas ""I need you""
Stay up I know these times ain't true
Real life, what's free?

Fed investigations, heard they plottin' like I trap

Not really paying attention what it do to my health
And I could tell you that this life ain't what it seems
But no matter what it is, I stay true to myself

I say, ""Young nigga rumble and stay humble through the fake shit""
All this money and bad bitches, I'm in the matrix
Tryna be successful and still fighting open cases
At times, I get angry at God, like, ""Why you take Nip'?""

Got me losing hope in the hood, I'm feeling hatred
From niggas that look just like me, same color faces
She say she ain't fuck in a year, I told her, ""Taste it""
She did it on the first night, and I'm looking for my first wife

Tryna find trust in my heart, but it don't work right
Think I'm getting numb to the pain, 'cause it don't hurt right
I just wanna go to my hood, wheelie a dirt bike
And post up on the block with the ones that think

Drinking whiskey, she likes vodka strong

No, I can't stay here and hold her

Always working, never hindered by a little fatigue
Rapping in arenas, I'm still playing in a different league

Dropping opportunities I'm picking up a different call
Holding out for bigger checks to lift us all

Flashbacks of a youngin' sipping that purple Kool Aid
Skipping school with my homies and chiefing reefer for two days
Running from the law, living how I'm living, fuck 'em all
Bumping Triple Six
Hennessy in my cup, driving through the sticks

Who the bitch riding with me?
Man, the devil tryna get me
Motivated, under-educated, and hated
But finally getting cake like a happy belated
Bitch I made it, we on

Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it
Write it, record it, mix it, master it, press it up, unveil it
Feel like I've been waiting forever, forever to inherit
This is war, I declare it
Time is money, I can't spare it

Futuristic, so simplistic
Please decipher my linguistics
Slow it down, Robitussin
I'm the king, ain't no discussion
And now we blowing up like spontaneous human combustion

My consumption is the illest
Section eight, I know you feel this
On the come up, where they run up on you for nothing at all
Brighter than eleven suns, this the first, where my funds?
EBT, that's the card

I thank God, I thank God, but it's hard, but it's hard

Work so fucking much my greates fear is imma die alone
Every diamond in my chain yeah thats a milestone
People calling me asking me for money man
The only thing imma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone

God damn, god damn, we at it again
Me and my homies that know me blowing up like the Taliban
Yeah, my stress up, but I'm blessed up
Fuck around and get messed up
When I murder the rhyme, I'm living divine

You know that I'm one of a kind
Lemme get it right now, ho
Draped up and I'm dripped out, right now, ho
Caked up 'til I cash out and I got 'em all wondering how, so
On the down low, haters drown slow
On the down low, haters drown slow

Oh God, my God, we got it all right
Oh God, my God, we gotta get it, right?

These fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
I said these fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?

Tell me that they love me, know damn well that they don't give a fuck
I be on that finger flipping killing shit up in the cut
That's what's up
All these bitches out here tryna gas it up
This is everything I ever wanted, I can't pass it up
Life changed in a year, couldn't happen fast enough

""Can I do it like you do it?"" That's what they be asking us
White Benz, black card, bitch better get your plastic up

Smokin' dope, listenin' to endless samples on vinyl
My flow primal, it ain't mixed, it ain't the final

I was in the crib, just sitting on the rug
Basedheads coming through looking for the plug

Now, born and raised in my area
Beautiful body by night, that's hysteria
Fuck around and bury ya tonight
Ridin' with my homies on sight
Momma told me to come in at night
Now I really gotta go, but they never know
Living life to the fullest, I got to blow

Po-po finna bust in the door, we got blow in the crib
In the kitchen over there next to the baby with the bib

Had days with hella' hate

All this shit that's on my plate

I can't get much higher
Been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher

No matter what happens, everything ain't gon' be the same
The incredible album, what an incredible outcome
I grip the mic and then talk to the people like I'm Malcolm
I used to think the fame and money was the motivation
Until I toured the world and met the people face to face and
Understood that the power was harnessed in that basement
It ain't about the money and notoriety
It's about the people and making a difference in society

The Godfather, the Goodfella wielding an Uzi

Better believe and think down and leave us, the baby cryin'
Crack, cooking where my sister be frying soul food

Plus my other sister just went back to her old dude
He whoopin' her ass, I kill him, I kill him, I motherfuckin' kill him
I said I really wanna kill him, but I can't

Little Bobby, just a youngin', skating was my hobby
Tryna stay out of trouble, my homie in jail for robbery

Welfare, food stamps, and stealing from the store
Come home and see an eviction notice taped to my door
Can't take no more, momma on drugs, daddy M.I.A
What can I say? I just wanted to be a kid and play
To this day I pay homage to the Gods, to the greats

Rip out my soul from the depths of my flesh
Flesh from my blood I caress
Right on the page so it's fresh
I take my time, but express
Lot on my mind, but I guess
It's just in my genes like a Glock 17, like a genetic scene

Kick in the door, we blow it off the hinge
Music my drug, tie it off, then inject the syringe
It's in my blood, ain't no need to pretend
Therapist tell me I don't need to defend
Therapy tell me I don't need to explain
Just drop the record on the needle and express my pain
Can't wait until my son shine and together we reign

My queen's by my side like Manhattan
Fuck rapping, this is poetic conviction
My rendition is not meant for your diction
Battled addiction in the womb
A crack baby by definition
Keys to ignition with no permission
That mean that I'm driven
Alive 'cause I'm living
Fuck workin' with what you've been given

I knew I always wanted more like The Roots in nine-five
And I'll be sure to do more for my family than mine did
'Cause hip-hop rhymes taught me more than my moms did
Didn't drink 'til I was 25 'cause I'm my mom's kid
All I knew was alcoholism and prison
Only saw domestic violence and racial division
Social worker trying to take me away
But I know that group home probably worse, hell nah, no way
At least I know my odds here, I'ma be okay
Adapted to the lifestyle, so I'ma be okay

Even when I win, it feel like I'm losin'
Listening to beats, in the Bimmer cruisin'
I think I got another hit, I could feel my body bruisin'
What's the conclusion of rappin'?
My hypothesis, I'm darker than Gotham is

Like readin' Nostradamus at 90 degrees
You better believe
I know how to turn a profit with ease
Diacritical lifestyle, I'm always overseas
Hurricane Bobby in the studio blowing trees

Your new shit ain't good as your old shit
'Til your new shit is your old shit, son
And then some, gotta get some
I wear this 24 karat solid gold Rollie for my son
As an heirloom, not for looking as dope as I rhyme
As a representation to give your family your time

If you're searching for love in the industry you'll be let down
They don't love you 'til you dead and then they call you profound
No matter how mainstream you was in the end, you still underground
That's the truth
Feeling close to the cliff, like Rick Dalton in the booth

Money ain't the key to happiness and this the proof
Modern day rap is like a golden era spoof
But a few of us were searching within the second renaissance
And I know that my debutantes
Been keeping the legacy going
By flowing so involuntarily seamless

I'm talkin' grass, I ain't talkin' grazing

Pass 'em the Tony, pass 'em the Oscar

From the new school rappers, yeah I'm the illest on the roster
Smoke like a rasta
Black and white like Bob Marley, yeah, like Bob Marley
These racist motherfuckers hate that last line
Probably haters on the internet ain't got nothing to bargain

The one that flow like a faucet I'm still the same me
They just don't believe it like they agnostic
If I spit over the boom-Bap, then they perceive it as nostaligic

And my production selection is still flame
But they love you on the come up 'cause you ain't tainted by fame
And you still they little secret

Scared to go out even with my security
Scared of the world and all of its obscurity

What would you do if you did it all? (If you did it all)

Would you linger like, ""Fuck 'em all""?
Guess that's your call, but I can't (It's your call, but I can't)

Till I spit one to her lip balm (chea!)

Polished it then got a big wallet where all of my dollars sit

Oh, oh, oh, I asked myself, ""What am I doin' here?""
Oh, oh, oh here, oh, oh, oh here

Super Mario World,Logic,"Lemme shout out Bobby cause, 6ix in there like
""Oh my goodness""
Nah, I just did that for the adlib-keep that (Squad!)
Yeah, oh my goodness, oh my goodness, oh my God!
Yeah, keep all that shit and this...
I'm like, oh my goodness, oh my-
And this, here we go, here we GO!
Yeah, Yeah!

I'm like, oh my goodness, oh my goodness, oh my God
I'm coming with the goodness
Acting like I ain't been in it, like I ain't been pushing my limit
Hold up, wait up, get your weight up!
We all people, fuck around get the fade up
They shit is made up, straight up!

Call me Bobby Tarantino living on the level
And I'm prophesizing everything we know
Because of the internet I made a million and another million
That's word to Gambino
He one of the realest, I swear he the realest
But anyway, back to the subject at hand
I just performed for an hour, performed for an hour
And made myself a hundred grand like...

Oh my goodness, oh my goodness, oh my goodness

Perfect (Remix) (feat. Lil Wayne & A$AP Ferg),Logic feat. Lil Wayne & A$AP Ferg,"Bitch, I did it, I made it, I'm loved and I'm hated
I started from the bottom, now my neighborhood is gated
They say, ""Drink to your accomplishments,"" so every night I'm faded
Feel like every other day, me and somebody new related
You're my sister, cousin, brother from the other side? (The other side)
Well, I don't know who told you that (my mama), well, she fucking lied

Ayy, wake up, wake up, get your cake up, cut it up like it's cocaine, shake up
All the streets with all these beats, I body beats, I'm not discreet (pеr-per-perfect)
This is how I feel on the inside
All you non-talent rappin' motherfuckers better run and hide
You worthless, you have no purpose, fuckin' imposter
You gots to get it through your head, you won't never get no handout
Fuckin' with your ass, it'd be like throwing a band out (per-per-perfect)

My flow increased, my dough increased, you know I leave them all deceased
I am a fucking beast, I'm from the East, I keep the peace, don't need a piece
But I keep a piece, got it, capisce? That boy gon' eat, this is a feast
Once I release, I'm smokin' trees, I bought my shit, I don't need no lease

So fuck you up like Master P (perfect), this shit right here a masterpiece
I'm comin' in hot like the police, shooting my shot like the police
All on the block like the police, man, who gon' (stop, stop)
The police from leaving bodies in the motherfuckin' streets, man?

High Today (feat. Logic),Wiz Khalifa feat. Logic,"Where is my mind? It's far away
Up in the sky, I'm high today
Break it on down, then we rollin' it up
I can see my house from up here
Who needs a jet when you're fly like me? Tell 'em
You don't need a jet to get high like me

I started off slow, but I finally made it
No matter the cost, chances I'm takin'
Ride with my dawgs, no, we ain't fakin'
Travel the world, countin' up faces
Jump in my car, roll up and face it
No, I don't call, I'm on her faces
All of 'em model, none of 'em basic
Girl, I'm a star, look in amazement

Top of the game, that's where my place is
Started off small, runnin' from cases
Can't take it back, I can't erase it
Money got long, I'm tryna chase it
Puffin' the J, I wanna get paid
It's one and the same, but that's every day
I'm livin' my life as real as I say
I spent it all once, so I'm tryna save

ICONIC (ft. Jaden Smith),Logic feat. Jaden,"Shout out to that boy Slim Shady for all the love, yeah!
(Sinatra)

Tell me what you know about real life
Tell me what you know about dark nights
Bitch, I'm Bruce Wayne in the game
You just perpetrating from the side line
What it feel like? (huh)
Metaphor game too silly
Punch lines way too silly
Fuck a Milli', now I'm coming for that William
Hold up, wait a minute, think about it, that's a Billi' (woo!)

God damn, boy, you know I'm putting in the work
I'ma get it, I got 'em and now they all hurt
I'm a let 'em know, I never let 'em know
They never seem to know that I am a master (at work)
Bitch I'm all up in it come and get it
You could never get rid of it
Every bit of it in this motherfucker
Like I'm in the middle of little Italy
A lot of shit was never given to me
That shit's a fallacy told by the enemy
Tryna get ahead of me
They dead to me, everybody dead to me
Everybody know that Bobby will body anybody
Like Gotti did Gambino, from Maryland to Reno
We know Tarantino a killer
But the Young Sinatra got you by the neck
And the spirit the second they hear it
They fear it as soon as they get near it
Everybody revere it like

Tell me-tell me-tell me what you know about real life, real life
Tell me what you know about dark nights, dark nights
Bitch, I'm Bruce Wayne in the game
You just perpetrating from the side line
What it feel like—feel like?
Metaphor game too silly
Punch lines way too silly
